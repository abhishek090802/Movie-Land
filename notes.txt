Reactjs:it is a frontend javascript library

javascript mastery notes:

it is used in the javascript stack(mern)

we don't update dom directly as like in case of html we directlt update the dom as soon as we refresh the page but here we uses is a virtual dom it is a javascript object
updating the virtual dom is much faster than real dom

rEAct virtual dom only updates the specific that were necessary not the whole page

javascript synthax that we used in the react is ES6 synthax

react js is a component based javascript library

every react application is tree of componenets

component is a small part of user interface

like sidebar,searchbar,navbar these are the various componenets in the react applications

two types of componenets in react:
a)functional componenets
b)class based component

class based copmponenets are not being used nowadays

only functional coponents are important

talking about functions as well there are three types of functions and those were:
normal function,arrow function,named function

mostly used function is arrow based function

the code and tags are not html that was jsx(javascript synthax)  it comes with the full power of javascript that is responsible for the how actually our webpage will look like

it forms the core of the react applications

there are two ways for setting up of the react applications:
1)manuallt setting up of all things using webpack and babel
2)using the create-react-app command

for beginners use the create-react-app command

use the command npx-create-react-app ./ (for creating an react application in the current directory)

for creating react application make sure that your pc has nodejs installed 
nodejs is a javascript runtime that allows to execute js code on the server

to run your react application on your browser:
npm start

all the logic will be in the source folder 

in public folder we have only one file that is index.html

all the react components are injected in the div id of root

in index.js we have reactdom which is used to render div with id of root and we populate our application to that id root

in app.js we have functional componennt and inside we can write jsx in it

the one difference b/w jsx and html like we use className in place of class as that in html bcz class is revserved kework in javascript that's why we use className
